A better understanding of the formation and decomposition of aerosolized
ammonium nitrate species should lead to improvements in the modeling of
aerosol haze formation. We found that simulated annealing Monte Carlo
optimizations via
[TransRot](https://github.com/steventopper/TransRot){target="_blank"}
combined with a well-chosen density functional theory model can be used
reliably to predict minimum-energy structures and interaction energies
for the cation and anion clusters observed in mass spectra as well as
for neutral nanoparticles. Our calculations made it possible to
rationalize the pattern of peaks in the mass spectra through computation
of the binding energies of clusters involved in various growth and
dissociation pathways. We were the first to identify the structures
corresponding to all detectable species in both the positive and
negative ion mass spectra of ammonium nitrate. We also study the
structures and interaction energies of larger
[(NH~4~NO~3~)~n~]{.chemical-formula} nanoparticles (shown to the right).

::: description
The molecule 2-hydroxyazobenzene is the building block for many dyes and
has the potential to undergo excited-state intramolecular proton
transfers (ESIPT). While its dominant non-radiative relaxation pathway
has been studied using static multi-reference methods, there is a lack
of research on its excited state molecular dynamics using *ab initio*
methods. Our work aims to address this gap by investigating the excited
state dynamics using the *ab initio* TAB method developed by the [Levine
Research
Group](https://levinegroup.org/people/benjamin-g-levine/){target="_blank"}.
This research will enhance our understanding of the photochemistry of
2-hydroxyazobenzene, providing a foundation for further investigations
of similar systems involving multiple ESIPT reactions.
